## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)



fuegos <- read_delim("fuegos.csv", delim = ";", escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE)
                                           
plot1 <- ggplot(fuegos, aes(x=year, y=n)) + geom_line()

plot1

ggplotly(plot1)

```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
